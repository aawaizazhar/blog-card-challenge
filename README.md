## What I Learned

While completing this project I deepened my understanding of:

```css
/* Using CSS custom properties for a coherent colour scheme */
:root {
  --yellow: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --gray-500: hsl(0, 0%, 42%);
  --gray-950: hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
}
```

```css
/* Creating an elevated "card" effect with a layered box-shadow */
.card {
  box-shadow: 0 15px 15px -5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1),
              0 5px 5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);
}
```

- Structuring content using Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) landmarks.
- Achieving perfect vertical & horizontal centring using modern layout techniques.
